["index.html", "Exploring the utility of human genetic interactions for gene function predictions Section 1 Overview", " Exploring the utility of human genetic interactions for gene function predictions Hai Fang University of Oxford Section 1 Overview As part of Epistasis: Methods and Protocols, Methods in Molecular Biology - Springer, we describe three showcases analysing human genetic interactions and/or gene expression data in human tissues (Materials), compatible with the concept of tidy data science (FIGURE ?? and FIGURE ??). All done exclusively using the R one-liner, defined as a sequential pipeline of elementary functions chained together achieving a complex task. We will guide the users through step-by-step instructions on ([Case 1]) how to identify, visualise and interpret network modules of genetic interactions; ([Case 2]) how to identify and interpret tissue-specific genetic interactions; and ([Case 3]) how to carry out genetic interaction-based tissue clustering and differential interaction analysis. All three showcases are producible on its own, achieved in relatively short runtime (~20 min for Case 1, ~15 min for Case 2, and ~25 min for Case 3). We encourage the users to run through these showcases before analysing their own datasets. "],
["materials.html", "Section 2 Materials", " Section 2 Materials R and packages At the time of writing, the most recent version of R is 4.0.2 (Dark and Stormy Night). The instructions of how to install R in different platforms (Linux, OS X and Windows) can be found at https://www.r-project.org where precompiled binaries are provided for download. For Linux users who do not have a sudo privilege, R could be installed from the source code at the home directory (that is, $HOME): wget https://cran.wu.ac.at/src/base/R-4/R-4.0.2.tar.gz tar xvfz R-4.0.2.tar.gz cd R-4.0.2 ./configure --prefix=$HOME/R-4.0.2 make make check make install $HOME/R-4.0.2/bin/R # start R We highly recommend using a dedicated package BiocManager to install and update any packages that have been deposited into Bioconductor and CRAN, two repositories that are exclusive to each other so that a package cannot be deposited into both. BiocManager should be installed first in a conventional way (i.e. using the function install.packages), and then can be used to install other packages in a single step. Once an additional package remotes also installed, BiocManager can be also used to install packages hosted at GitHub, usually as a development repository prior to submission into Bioconductor or CRAN. # first, install the package BiocManager install.packages(&quot;BiocManager&quot;) # then install packages from Bioconductor and CRAN BiocManager::install(c(&quot;biobroom&quot;,&quot;dnet&quot;,&quot;ggrepel&quot;,&quot;gridExtra&quot;,&quot;limma&quot;,&quot;patchwork&quot;,&quot;remotes&quot;,&quot;tidyverse&quot;,&quot;osfr&quot;), dependencies=T) # can also install packages from GitHub BiocManager::install(&quot;hfang-bristol/XGR&quot;) Genetic interactions We extracted human genetic interactions from BioGRID (version 3.5.179) involving 3102 genes (mapped to NCBI GeneID; the same hereinafter) and their 7856 interactions. This dataset was preprocessed into an igraph object (using the igraph package), saved as an RData-formatted file ig.BioGRID_genetic.RData, deposited at https://osf.io/gskpn). ig.BioGRID_genetic ## IGRAPH 56d837e UN-- 3198 7968 -- ## + attr: stamp (g/n), name (v/c), description (v/c), nPMID (e/n) ## + edges from 56d837e (vertex names): ## [1] A1BG --REV3L A2M --KRAS AAGAB --TP53 AAMP --KRAS ## [5] AANAT --P2RY6 AANAT --SPHK1 AANAT --SSTR5 AANAT --TOP1 ## [9] AARS2 --LEO1 AARS2 --MRPS16 AARS2 --MRPS5 AARS2 --PSMB6 ## [13] AATF --DONSON AATF --GFI1B AATF --MCM3AP ABCB5 --CSK ## [17] ABCB5 --KRAS ABCB7 --AURKA ABCB7 --HSCB ABCB7 --LONP1 ## [21] ABCB7 --MBTPS2 ABCB7 --MED23 ABCB7 --NUBP1 ABCB7 --PITRM1 ## [25] ABCB7 --TAF2 ABCC4 --MPP1 ABCE1 --KRAS ABCG2 --CSK ## [29] ABCG5 --FLT3 ABHD5 --KRAS ABL1 --RPS6KB1 ABRACL--CSK ## + ... omitted several edges "],
